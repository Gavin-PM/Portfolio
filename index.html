                    <p>This project combines my interest in Musical Composition, Alto Saxophone, and the Piano into an adaptation of the piece, "Fly Me to the Moon". </p>
                    <p>Originally composed by Frank Sinatra, I added more rhythms and added my own spin onto the song. In total, it consists of 1 piano and 3 saxophones playing.</p>
                    <p>These were all recorded in different sessions, and pieced together in premiere pro using my score. </p>

                    <p> "The Daily Recap" is a project that serves as a reminder to all of our classmates. It contains homework and reminders that we'd like to inform our classmates of.</p>
                    <p> Since the first issue (nearly 2 years ago), we have done more than 150 versions of the Daily Recap.</p>
                    <p> Mostly, it is completed by Afra Miao and I (roughly half participation each). Sometimes, Lucas Yang also helps with the design.</p>

                    <p>The Xi'An vlog was from a "China Trip" to Xi'An, thus, it was made in Chinese. All videos except that one are posted publically on YouTube.</p>
                    <p>They are: Xi'An Travel Vlog on Transportation (G7), Orbital Mechanics Part 1 (G6), Process of Building Geometric Shapes (G6), and Explanation of a Math Problem (G6).</p>

                    Obviously, these are all done by myself.
                    <br> The video on geometric shapes was inspired by Mark Rober.
                    <br> The game/demo that was in the orbital mechanics video was Kerbal Space Program.
